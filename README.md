# Fulmar::Plugin::MariaDB

You want to develop your own fulmar plugin? Great! This gem is an example on how to build a fulmar plugin.

A plugin needs to implement at least the Configuration class within the Fulmar::Plugin::YourName namespace. You can
add methods available in the tasks by putting them into the dsl_helper.rb. You can supply globally available tasks in
the rake files.

Please feel free to ask for help.

## Installation

Since this is an example gem, it is not actually available in the rubygems repository. Hopefully. :)

## Usage

Have a look at the code, build your own plugin and don't forget to search for all appearances of "example" before
publishing.
